# ChangeU

ChangeU, consists of a decentralized open source application, with the following main features:

Financial planner: helps the user to know how much they should save and invest to achieve their goals, for example, going to university or paying for a programming course.

Delfi - a fully automated and personalized investment broker. The user never
loses custody of the money. It is not necessary to be banked, have a minimum capital to start, or have previous financial knowledge.

Education and games: the section where users can learn about finance, cryptocurrencies and investments. It has quizzes in the form of trivia and different levels. The more points the user has, the more eligible they will be to receive donations from other users. 

Transparent donation network. Not everyone will be able to meet their goal of going to college with their own savings. This is why users have the option of financially supporting others and getting involved in their lives (p2p donation network) or supporting different charitable causes.


Xcapit Dapp: is a distributed application that interacts with a smart contract ([XcapitContract](https://github.com/xcapit/Xcapit-Contract)) that allows you to set investment objectives on it and keep track of your goals. It communicates with the Brainy Core services that recommend which investment funds to generate with the risk profiles. Also, Xcapit Dapp use [xwallet](https://github.com/xcapit/xwallet).
